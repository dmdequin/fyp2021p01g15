In this notebook, make an initial exploratory data analysis, where you:
-- DONE load the data
-- report the dimensions of the data (number of tables, rows, fields)
-- identify for each variable whether it is numerical or categorical
-- Make the following sanity check: Does every AccidentID in the casualties and vehicles tables have their corresponding AccidentID in the accident table?
-- report a five number summary for all numerical variables (where this makes sense)
-- report a box plot for all numerical variables (where this makes sense)
-- report a frequency histogram for all numerical variables, and a frequency bar plot for all categorical variables (where this makes sense)
