# First Year Project 1 Group 15
## Road collisions analysis, Michael Szell

We are simulating working for a department of transport to inform city leaders, via a report,
about the state of road safety in the city. We explore the latest data set of all recorded 
road collisions in Great Britain in the year 2019 provided by the UK Department of Transport 
with details about the circumstances of personal injury.


We explore the city of **Birmingham**.

### The major parts of the project are:
- Exploring and transforming the data, making numerical and visual reports
- Connecting data tables (accidents, vehicles, casualties)
- Investigating possible statistical associations by filtering for a variety of attributes
- Visualizing the data on a map
- Involving self-obtained external data sets in the analysis
